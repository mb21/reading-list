## Programming

### Books

- [Grokking Simplicity](https://www.manning.com/books/grokking-simplicity) (how to write cleaner and simpler software using functional thinking, demonstrated in JavaScript)

- [Designing Data-Intensive Applications](https://dataintensive.net)

- [Thinking in Systems: A Primer](https://wtf.tw/ref/meadows.pdf) by Donella H. “Dana” Meadows (1993)

  A _System_ is something that’s greater than the sum of its parts, usually contains feedback loops and often behaves unintuitively. The following can all be understood as systems: a room with a thermostat, a bathtub with an in- and outlet, ecosystems in biology, population dynamics, depletion of non-renewable resources, organizations (e.g. companies), economies, and many more.

  > It is remarkable that Dana is able to explain with such clarity such systems concepts of stocks, flows, feedback, time delays, resilience, bounded rationality [, leverage points], and system boundaries and to illustrate each one with multiple informative examples. – Bill Moomaw## Space

- [Managing Humans](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/managing-humans-biting/9781430243144/) (Good and light-hearted read for programmers becoming managers the first time.)
