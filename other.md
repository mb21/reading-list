  A _System_ is something that’s greater than the sum of its parts, usually contains feedback loops and often behaves unintuitively. The following can all be understood as systems: a room with a thermostat, a bathtub with an in- and outlet, ecosystems in biology, population dynamics, depletion of non-renewable resources, organizations (e.g. companies), economies, and many more.

  > It is remarkable that Dana is able to explain with such clarity such systems concepts of stocks, flows, feedback, time delays, resilience, bounded rationality [, leverage points], and system boundaries and to illustrate each one with multiple informative examples. – Bill Moomaw## Space
